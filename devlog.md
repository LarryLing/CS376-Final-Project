Game: Krillin Ball
Description: You are Krillin from Dragon Ball. You spawn on a platform that tilts in every direction. On the platform lies the seven Dragon Balls on it that Krillin will need to collect. The way you move Krillin around is by tilting the platform and letting Krillin roll. Make sure to avoid the holes though, or else you will fall straight into Hell. Collect all seven Dragon Balls!

To do:
Figure out how to attach Dragon Balls to platform without having them fall due to gravity
 Attach it to the platform in hierarchy
